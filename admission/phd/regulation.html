						If the CGPA of the candidate is not on a scale of 10 but on a scale of K

				<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Operational Details of Teaching Assistantship</h3>
				<p>
					The stipend given to Ph.D. students is called Teaching Assistantship. Students
					receiving Teaching Assistantships are called Teaching Assistants (TAs). This TA
					ship is mandatory for all funded students
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					The typical number is one TA for every 15 students in Theory courses and one TA
					for every 10 students in Lab courses. But a department can allot the work
					appropriately considering the unique features of each course and lab.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Each TA will be assigned to work with a faculty member in their respective
					department. The concerned faculty member is responsible for monitoring TA's
					work. This typically involves the TA maintaining a work schedule signed and
					approved by the concerned faculty to ensure this average is maintained; the
					respective department and the responsible faculty can decide on the format. If a
					TA feels overworked, she/ he can approach the department regarding this.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>The following are some sets of duties a TA can be asked to perform</p>
				<ul
					style="list-style: decimal"
					class="p-4">
					<li>
						<p>Conducting Tutorials</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Maintaining software and hardware and information related to academic
							activities in the department.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Grading answer sheets, and assignments and assisting in conducting
							vivas, and seminars.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Help students with difficulties: TAs should be available during regular
							office hours to clear doubts about the course. The limit should be Two
							hours per week.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Arranging instruments/software/hardware related to courses or labs.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Attending Classes: If the TA is asked to attend classes by the
							instructor, then attending one hour of class accounts for one hour of
							TA.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The following are the working hours expected of a TA</p>
				<ul
					style="list-style: decimal"
					class="p-4">
					<li>
						<p>On average, the TA must work for eight hours per week (six days).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							A student's own research work (for thesis) or research with a faculty in
							his lab does not count in TAship hours.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							If a TA works less than average in some months then the work has to be
							compensated later. The overall average should be monitored over a
							semester rather than over a month.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The provision to stop scholarships should be taken in case the work done
							during the entire semester is below the average. Renewal of
							assistantship every semester is subject to good performance during the
							preceding semester.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							If the TA works during vacations, then the average should be monitored
							over a month. TA's work during the vacations can't be counted towards
							the total work done in the next semester.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>AIMS can be used for approving/ disapproving the stipend of the TAs</p>

				<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Guide Allocation Procedure</h3>
				<p>
					Each student will have a Project/ Research Supervisor, referred to as a Guide
					from the faculty of the parent Department to which he/she is admitted. In
					addition, a co-guide from the same or another Department may be co-opted by the
					guide (in some special cases like external Ph.D. students, the co-guide can also
					be from outside IIITR).
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					The procedure for the selection of guides for the thesis varies departmentally.
					In general, guide allocation happens immediately after the student joins Ph.D.
					To the extent possible, the preferences of the student in the area of research
					interest are taken into account and the student is given the freedom to choose
					his/her guide based on the area of research interest. Once the student joins,
					they are advised to consult their faculty advisors regarding the same.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>The categories of Co-guide for a Ph.D. student are as follows:</p>
				<ul
					style="list-style: decimal"
					class="p-4">
					<li>
						<p>
							A faculty member reaching superannuation and has less than three years
							of service at the Institute
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>On-contract faculty at the institute.</p>
					</li>

						<p>
							Industry professionals with a Ph.D. degree on the recommendation of the
							HoD, Dean (Academics), and Director approves the appointment of a
							co-guide.
						</p>

				</ul>
				<p>
					After the research supervisor allocation to a student, the student under the
					supervision of a guide has to complete the programme.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="py-2">
				<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Change of Research Supervisor</h3>
				<p>
					If a student is willing to change his/her research supervisor, then the student
					has to inform first to the HoD. The HoD will take the consent of the current
					research supervisor(s), new research supervisor, and Dean of Academics. The
					change of research supervisor will be before 1 year and 6 months from the date
					of admission, after this period students can not change the supervisor. In the
					unforeseen conditions (supervisor resigning & death of supervisor), a new
					research supervisor will be assigned.

							be given a second attempt, not before one month, and within three months
							from the date of the first attempt. If the student fails on the second
							attempt, he/she will not be allowed to continue with the Ph.D.
							Programme.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Within 6 months of the successful completion of the Comprehensive
							Examination, a student presents a Ph.D. Research Proposal Seminar (RPS)
							within 18 months of admission of the PhD. The presentation is open to
							all. In this, he/she presents problem identification, literature survey,
							and preliminary research plan.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							A student submits a write-up to the DC members at least one week before
							the date of the RPS.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							A report on the successful completion of the RPS, is submitted by the DC
							to the Chairman, DC who communicates the same to the Director.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Original work should be carried out at least partly under the
							supervision of a research guide from among the faculty members of IIITR
							and defended in the form of a thesis. A co-guide, if needed, may be
							co-opted from IIITR, industry, or another institute of repute with the
							recommendation from the Dean of Academics/Director.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Publication of at least two research papers in Scopus/SCI-indexed
							journals (or one in Scopus-indexed journals and another in a
							Scopus-indexed conference/proceedings).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							A guide will be allotted as soon as the student joins the Ph.D. program
							based on the choices given by the student. The guide will constitute a
							Doctoral Committee (DC), the DC member must have two external, one
							internal, HoD, and a guide. The external must be from an institute of
							national importance or industry with a Ph.D. degree. A faculty member of
							IIITR outside the parent department will act as Chairman of the
							committee.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The DC would conduct a progress seminar at least once a year for the
							first 3-years (from the date of Ph.D. admission) to evaluate the
							progress of the work. After 3-years, these progress seminars should be
							held every six months.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							If the research progress is unsatisfactory, the supervisor will call for
							the Doctoral Committee (DC) to evaluate the progress. If DC finds the
							progress unsatisfactory, an appropriate time interval (minimum of 3
							months) will be set to improve the performance. If DC finds that the
							progress still remains unsatisfactory, Ph.D. registration will stand
							terminated.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							An MoE-funded Ph.D. student is eligible to convert to SRF (senior
							research fellow) after two years as a JRF (Junior Research Fellow). This
							JRF to SRF conversion assessment should be done by a committee having an
							external examiner also. This external examiner can be a part of the
							regular Doctoral Committee and can be a faculty from the other
							department also. In addition, if a faculty member wishes, he/she may
							also involve an examiner from outside IIITR. For students supported by
							other funding agencies, their respective norms prescribed for JRF to SRF
							conversion will be followed.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					For the external/sponsored Ph.D., the following rules, in addition to the
					above-mentioned, are applicable:
				</p>
				<ul
					style="list-style: decimal"
					class="p-4">
					<li>
						<p>
							The Program is aimed at candidates from national research laboratories/
							reputed industrial organizations where research work can be carried out.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The guide will be allotted at the beginning. Nevertheless, it is
							recommended that the procedure outlined above for regular Ph.D. students
							should be followed.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							No stipend will be paid to the student; however, he/she may be employed
							in a project, full or part-time.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Candidates from reputed research organizations may have a co-guide from
							their research organization.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							External Ph.D. students do not have a residency requirement to take
							their courses; with the permission of their advisor, they also have the
							option of taking video and self-study-based coursework.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							External Ph.D. students should complete the Comprehensive Examination
							within 18 12 months from the time of joining. In case of unsatisfactory
							performance, a second attempt is allowed within three months, failing
							which Ph.D. registration will lapse. Also, the student needs to present
							a Research Proposal Seminar (RPS) Within 6 months of the successful
							completion of the Comprehensive Examination.

				<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Thesis Submission and Evaluation Guidelines</h3>
				<ul
					style="list-style: decimal"
					class="p-4">
					<li>
						<p>
							Prerequisite for submission of Ph.D. thesis: The student must have at
							least two research papers (published or accepted) in Scopus-indexed
							journals (or one in Scopus indexed journal and another in a
							Scopus-indexed conference/proceedings) to be eligible for the submission
							of a doctoral thesis.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Open colloquium: On completion of the doctoral research, the student has
							to give an open colloquium. As the name implies it is open to the entire
							institute. The doctoral committee (as many members as possible of DC)
							and the guide will have to be present in the colloquium. The requirement
							for an open colloquium is a thesis draft and the guide’s approval and
							the first page of the publications. The draft will be sent to the
							doctoral committee at least two weeks before the colloquium. The student
							will have to incorporate the suggestions that come from the open
							colloquium. The revised thesis meant for sending to the examiners should
							be submitted within one month of the successful completion of the open
							colloquium.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Extended synopsis: The student will have to submit an extended synopsis
							(8-10 pages) that will be sent to external examiners.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Opting for examiners/ reviewers from Abroad/Central
							University/NITs/IITs/IISc: The guide may opt for examiners/ reviewers
							from abroad, however, this is not mandatory.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Choosing the External examiners/ reviewers: The guide will have to
							submit a list of 8 external experts to the Dean Academic’s Office
							forwarded through the HOD.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Defense pattern and examination committee: The defense will be open to
							all followed by a closed-door Q&A.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The extended synopsis will be sent to three external reviewers. After reading
					through the extended synopsis if they agree to review the thesis, then the
					thesis will be sent to all (3 reviewers). If any of them refuses to review the
					thesis, the dean academic will contact other examiners from the list submitted
					by the thesis supervisor. The thesis will be sent to the reviewer as and when
					one agrees to review the thesis. The reviewers will be given 2 months time to
					submit a report. Once two positive reports are received, one of the reviewers
					(nominated by the Dean, Acad) will be invited in person to attend the thesis
					defense. Subsequently, the defense date can be scheduled by the guide in
					consultation with the reviewer. The report submitted by the other reviewer will
					be given to the external examiner and the external examiner may even ask
					questions based on the reviewer’s report. In this case, the final examination
					committee will consist of the supervisor(s), one external examiner, one internal
					examiner, and Chairman who is from outside the department.
				</p>
				<ul
					style="list-style: decimal"
					class="p-4">
					<li>
						<p>
							Choosing the exam pattern: The choice of selecting the exam pattern
							remains with the student. The student ‘may’ consult with the thesis
							supervisor for making a choice.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Preparing the thesis: The thesis must be prepared in a format prescribed
							by the institute and a soft copy of the thesis must be submitted to the
							library for archiving. Plagiarism check/ similarity index mandatory to
							be submitted along with Thesis submission.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Chairman: Any Faculty of IIITR outside the parent department of the
							candidate may be appointed as Chairman.

				<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Termination & Exit Options</h3>
				<p>
					The enrolment of a student to the institute will lapse after the maximum
					permissible duration. Hence, a student who is not able to complete the
					graduation requirements within the maximum permissible time will deem to be
					automatically terminated from the program. The Senate may approve an extension
					of duration on a case-by-case basis. However, the termination of the student
					remains in effect until such an extension is approved by the Senate. If the
					extension is approved, the student is expected to complete the registration and
					fee-related formalities till the completion of the program. Continuation of
					hostel accommodation in the case of such extension is not assured and is subject
					to availability.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					In addition, the following conditions will also warrant the termination of a
					student from Ph.D. program:
				</p>
				<ul
					style="list-style: decimal"
					class="p-4">
					<li>
						<p>
							If the student obtains a CGPA below 7 for both unreserved and reserved
							categories, at the end of the first two semesters.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							If the CGPA falls between 6.5 and 7.0 at the end of the first year of
							coursework, the student will be allowed to take courses in the third
							semester to meet a CGPA of 7.0. In this case, the research proposal
							defense should be extended by one more semester; if already completed,
							the research proposal defense will be considered only provisional
							subject to the subsequent increase in the CGPA. If a CGPA of 7.0 cannot
							be met at the end of the third semester for both unreserved and reserved
							categories, registration will stand terminated.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							If the student accumulates two or more FR/FS grades during the course
							work.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							If the student does not clear the Comprehensive Examination in two
							attempts (the second attempt should be within three months of the first
							attempt).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							If the research progress is unsatisfactory, the supervisor will call for
							the Doctoral Committee (DC) to evaluate the progress. If DC finds the
							progress unsatisfactory, an appropriate time interval (minimum of three
							months) will be set to improve the performance. If DC finds that the
							progress still remains unsatisfactory, registration will stand
							terminated.
