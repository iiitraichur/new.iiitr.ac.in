National Flag Adoption day with a feeling of pride and patriotism. On Jul 22, 1947, the Indian National Flag was adopted in the Constituent Assembly meeting and turned into the official flag of the Dominion of India on Aug 15, 1947, and later retained for the Republic of India. The flag's three colors represent the attributes of sacrifice, prosperity, and peace in the nation.
