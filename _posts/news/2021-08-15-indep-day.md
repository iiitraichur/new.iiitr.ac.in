The grand day of August 15th, when India attained Independence from the foreign forces, was celebrated with hoisting the flag of our mighty country, which, rippling high above made everyone stand tall with patriotism and pride. IIIT Raichur wishes all a very Happy Independence Day to all and aspires unity, brotherhood and strength among us Indians against anyone who threatens to suppress our identity and pride.
