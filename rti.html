            <h4>
                Online Payment:Right to Information (RTI) is an Act of the Indian Parliament enforced from the year
                2005, to provide for a practical regime for citizens to secure access to information under the control
                of public authorities. The basic object of the Right to Information Act is to empower the citizens,
                promote transparency and accountability in the working of the Government, contain corruption, and make
                our democracy work for the people in real sense. It goes without saying that an informed citizen is
                better equipped to keep necessary vigil on the instruments of governance and make the government more
                accountable to the governed. The Act is a big step towards making the citizens informed about the
                activities of the Government For more information please click <a href="https://rti.gov.in/">here</a>
