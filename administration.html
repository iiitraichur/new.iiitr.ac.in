					Dear Friends, <br /><br />
					It gives me immense pleasure to be part of the IIIT Raichur (IIITR), and it is
					indeed a matter of pride for IIT Hyderabad (IITH) to be a mentor institute for
					IIITR. This is a significant step in the direction of uplifting standards and
					enhancing the horizon of higher education and research in the country. As a
					mentor institute, IITH is excited to render its acquired expertise to the IIITR
					in all possible measures to make it a World-class Educational Institute.
					<br /><br />
					Our Deans have been providing their rich Academic, Research and Industrial
					proficiency for the courses being offered and enhancing employability of the
					students. IITHâ€™s Faculty members have been leaving no stone unturned to lay a
					strong academic foundation for the IIITR, impart its decade of academic
					experience and bring best practices right from its inception. Staff from
					different departments/sections of the IITH have also worked hard to ensure
					seamless commencement of the Academic year (2019-2020) for the first batch of
					IIITR at IITH Campus. <br /><br />
					Going to be based on the land of historic importance, Raichur, I am sure, IIITR
					will emerge as the state-of-the-art institute, both in research and academics
					under the IITH's able mentorship. <br /><br />
					On behalf of the entire team of IITH, I wish all the luck for IIITR with the
					promise of extending continued support to IIITR in future too.

					Dear Friends, <br />
					<br />
					Welcome. I am happy to associate with IIIT Raichur as a founding member. The
					institution is geared to provide ample opportunities for the youth to develop
					themselves into budding engineers with career options of working in top-notch
					companies, research, or entrepreneurship. With the pioneer batch completing
					their graduation in 2023, the institute would provide all options for higher
					education, research, innovation, and incubation. <br />
					<br />
					Due to wonderful support from the centre and state government, the permanent
					campus is initiated with all the essentials to become a campus with a full
					ambiance of excellence. With the current session of 2022, the seats have been
					doubled due to the overwhelming response gathered from previous batches. More
					branches are planned to be launched in the next year. <br />
					<br />
					Founded and continued mentorship by IIT Hyderabad, the innovative academics and
					assessments offer huge options and electives to the students to tune their
					careers. Various sports, cultural, and technology clubs develop the student's
					overall personality, ready to embrace the future. The council of students
					develops their leadership qualities as well. <br />
					<br />
					We are creating an ambiance of excellence on the campus where students develop
					their ideas and themselves together. Where they not only develop solutions for
					the problems known but also learn how to define problems that have not yet
					surfaced. Where the faculty not only spends their efforts towards imparting
					education but also developing their profile on a global front. Where the
					industry not only looks for talented engineers but also seeks advice from
					faculty toward their research and innovations. In nutshell, it is a campus where
					society and the environment initiate both problems and solutions. <br />
					<br />
					With outstanding progress in the formation years, the institute looks forward to
					all kinds of partnerships in institution building. The faculty is already taking
					the lead in this regard, the students are also growing in this journey. The
					future lies in widening such opportunities by welcoming the youth, industry, and
					prospective stakeholders from society to become part of this promising institute
					of national importance.
